# Overby.LINQPad.FileDriver

## What's it do?

This driver allows you to define a connection and point it to a folder full of data files (csv only for now). A datacontext will be generated so that you can query the files in the folder. Each file in the folder will have a class generated for it. Each property in the generated class will have the type that best fits the data in the file.
